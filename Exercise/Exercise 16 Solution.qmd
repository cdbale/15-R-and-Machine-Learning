1. Read the case and write how you might meet the expectations (no more than one page) in Quarto.
2. In the same Quarto document, write a function for simulating data that uses conditional statements and a for loop. Call it and print the output.
3. Render the Quarto document into Word and upload to Canvas.

**Five points total, one point each for:**

- **Write how you might meet the expectations of the case.**
- **Write a function for simulating data.**
- **Including conditional statements in your function.**
- **Including a for loop in your function.**
- **Submitting a rendered Word document.**

## Meeting Expectations

We will need an accurate supervised model to identify customers that are likely to churn, one or more unsupervised models to segment customers, and a series of natural language processing techniques to look at sentiment and identify topics of customer discussion.

## Write a Function

```{r}
sim_data <- function(nobs = 500) {
  # Create an empty vector for data.
  data <- vector(mode = "double", length = nobs)
  for (n in seq_along(data)) {
    if (n < nobs/2) {
      data[n] <- runif(n = 1, min = 10, max = 50)
    } else {
      data[n] <- runif(n = 1, min = 50, max = 100)
    }
  }

  # Return simulated data.
  return(data)
}

# Call sim_data.
sim_data(nobs = 10)
```
